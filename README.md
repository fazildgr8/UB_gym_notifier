# UB_gym_notifier
A python-based web content monitoring app to notify available Gym session slots for UB students. As the UB gyms require a prior booking of the time slots but it tedious to get a slot due to decreased capacity as everything gets filled by the start of the week itself. This app would notify you through notify.run web client app whenever there is a free slot available throughout the week which puts in advantage to book slots compared with other people. The python script is deployed in the GCP Debian cloud computer and is executed continuously every 15 minutes.
